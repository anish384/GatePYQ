For storing these files on disk, we can use either 100 byte disk blocks or 200 byte disk blocks (but can't mix block sizes). For each block used to store a file, 4 bytes of bookkeeping information also needs to be stored on the disk. Thus, the total space used to store a file is the sum of the space taken to store the file and the space taken to store the book keeping information for the blocks allocated for storing the file. A disk block can store either bookkeeping information for a file or data from a file, but not both.\nWhat is the total space required for storing the files using 100 byte disk blocks and 200 byte disk blocks respectively? <br><br><strong>(GATE IT 2005)</strong></p>",
